# AP Pop-Up

AP Pop-Up is set of tools to work with `nmcli` to enable WiFi management.  This started as a "please start an access point so I can `ssh` in to my headless Pi when there are no known networks available" project.  As things do, I kept "improving", and I will never get my time back, so I share it here in the hopes that someone will benefit from it.
